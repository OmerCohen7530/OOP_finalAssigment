# README - Course System

## System Overview
The Course System is a robust and scalable platform designed to manage courses, users, and student enrollments within educational institutions. It provides advanced functionalities such as course creation, enrollment management, and user authentication with fine-grained access control. The system leverages cutting-edge design patterns to ensure efficiency, modularity, and maintainability.

## Features
1. **Course Management:**
   - Create, update, and delete courses using the **Factory** design pattern for flexible course instantiation.
   - Optimize memory usage with the **Flyweight** pattern by reusing existing course objects.
   - Enhance course functionalities, such as adding "Master" status, with the **Decorator** pattern to allow customizable course properties.

2. **System Initialization:**
   - Operates as a **Singleton**, ensuring a single instance of the system is active, preventing duplication and maintaining global state consistency.

3. **User Enrollment:**
   - Add users to the system and enroll them in courses with minimal effort.
   - Notify students of updates, such as course availability, using the **Observer** pattern for real-time communication.
   - Simplify complex operations like enrollment and course management with the **Facade** pattern, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

4. **Authentication and Permissions:**
   - Enforce strict permission validation to ensure only authorized users can perform operations (e.g., restricting course creation to admin users).
   - Provide a secure environment for managing sensitive data.

## Design Patterns in Use
1. **Singleton:** Maintains a single instance of the system for centralized and consistent operation.
2. **Observer:** Automatically notifies students of important updates like course availability.
3. **Factory:** Facilitates the creation of different course types, such as electives, required courses, and seminars.
4. **Flyweight:** Ensures efficient memory management by reusing existing objects instead of creating duplicates.
5. **Decorator:** Extends course functionalities dynamically without altering the base class structure.

## How to Use the System
1. **Installation and Execution:**
   - Download the source code and run the system in a **Java**-compatible environment.
   - Utilize the provided `main` class to test all system functionalities and simulate real-world scenarios.

2. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Validate the system by testing various operations, including permission validation, course creation, and enrollment processes.
   - Ensure proper notifications for students by simulating course updates.

3. **Performance and Scalability:**
   - The system is built with scalability in mind, capable of handling large user bases and course catalogs without compromising performance.
